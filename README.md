# Pigeon

Pigeon SDK for Ruby

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pigeon'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pigeon

## Usage

```ruby
parcel = { to: 'john@example.com' }

Pigeon.deliver('message-identifier', parcel)
```

- Message identifier is used to identify the message. Grab this from your [Pigeon](https://pigeonapp.io) dashboard.
- Parcel accepts `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `data` and `attachments`.


### Parcel sample (Single recipient)

```ruby
parcel = {
  to: 'John Doe <john@example.com>',
  cc: [
    'admin@example.com',
    'Sales Team <sales@example.com>'
  ],
  data: {
    # template variables are added here
    name: 'John'
  }
  attachments: [
    # :file can be a remote URL, local file path, or a File object
    {
      file: 'https://example.com/guide.pdf',
      name: 'Guide'
    },
    {
      file: '/path/to/logo.png',
      name: 'Logo'
    }
  ]
}
```

### Parcel sample (Multiple recipients)

```ruby
parcels = [
  {
    to: 'John Doe <john@example.com>',
    data: {
      # template variables are added here
      name: 'John'
    }
  },
  {
    to: 'Jane Doe <jane@example.com>',
    data: {
      # template variables are added here
      name: 'Jane'
    }
  }
]
```
